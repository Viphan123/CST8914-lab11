## Questions:
1. What is the keyboard interaction missing?
Navigation using Arrow Up and Arrow Down.
First/last header navigation using Home and End.
Toggling accordion state using Enter or Space.
2. What is the ARIA missing?
role="button" for headers.
aria-expanded to indicate the toggle state.
aria-controls to link headers with content sections.
role="region" for content areas to improve screen reader accessibility.
